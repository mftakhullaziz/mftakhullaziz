### 💎 About
Hello! Welcome to this profile. My way of development is very simple: I like to work on small personal projects for fun (like the ones that are pinned) but I work mostly on freelance projects at [Workana](https://www.workana.com/freelancer/80b3d81eb99245381c7320dedc76f0b8?ref=user_dropdown) and [99Freelas](https://www.99freelas.com.br/user/Laks-Castro)

### 💻 Programming
```
- I can build some cool stuff with...
1. Javascript
2. Typescript
3. Dart
4. C++
5. Java
6. Kotlin
